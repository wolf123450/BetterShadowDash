BetterShadowDash mod makes dashing act like I thought it should.  
It might break game balance, but should be relatively unbuggy.

Changes:

* Hitting enemies while shadow dashing with the sharp shadow charm recharges MP by 16.  
TODO: have this amount change based on soul catcher and soul eater charms.

* OVERFLOWING SOUL EFFECTS (When soul and soul reserve full): 
  * Hitting enemies with sharp shadow heals the knight by 1 mask every 2 hits.  
    TODO: admittedly this seems broken, we'll see if having this only apply while soul meter is full fixes it enough, might have to increase the number of hits to healing ratio.
  * Shadow Dash cooldown is the same as the normal dash cooldown, so no recharging.  This combines with the dashmaster charm as well.  
    TODO: hide shadow dash reset animation.
  * Hitting enemies with sharp shadow resets air dash and air jump.


The idea is to buff sharp shadow, at the cost of being able to use spells and get the better effects at the same time.
